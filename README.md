Powerlift is a game about keeping up your gains :muscle::triumph:

When you're not working out, you're loosing muscle power. Keep it up by working sets!
Be careful though: Don't overwork your body parts! Try to do exercises that let parts of you rest. You can also rest with 2X recovery bonus, but your gains drop faster too!
